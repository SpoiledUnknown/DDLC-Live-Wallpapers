## How to Install

1. Install any live wallpaper app for your OS that supports website/HTML.  
   **Note:** I recommend using [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively), another FOSS. I don't provide support for any other wallpaper app.
2. Copy the GitHub Pages URL or download the zip from the [releases](https://github.com/SpoiledUnknown/Natsuki-Live/releases/tag/v0.6.3) and extract it to your desired location.

3. Set it inside the wallpaper app:  
   3.1. Open **Lively Wallpaper**.  
   3.2. Click on the plus (+) button in the top right.  
   3.3. Select the wallpaper.

That's it! For any tips and suggestions, feel free to create an issue or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/YykdmCjzmQ) server.
